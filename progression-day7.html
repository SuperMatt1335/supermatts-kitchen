                    <p class="mb-4">With most of the decomposed granite already in place from the previous workdays, our focus today was on strengthening and sealing the pathways. I was able to secure an organic binding agent to mix into the DG, which would help solidify the surface and prevent future erosion. We also rented a heavy-duty compactor to achieve a dense, stable finish. By the end of the day, the pathways were fully compacted and ready to handle foot traffic, marking a major milestone toward completing the landscaping phase.</p>

                        <li class="mb-2">Applied organic binding agent to the decomposed granite for long-term durability.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Rented and operated a mechanical compactor to fully compress the pathways.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Completed final grading and smoothing, ensuring the walkways were level and consistent throughout the garden.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Prepared the site for upcoming installations, including benches, statues, and new plantings.</li>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Technical Learning</h2>
                    <p>This workday provided valuable hands-on experience with materials and equipment typically used in professional landscaping. I learned how to properly mix and apply a binding agent to stabilize decomposed granite and how to operate a plate compactor safely and effectively. Understanding the importance of moisture control, even distribution, and timing during compaction was key to achieving a smooth, durable finish. These lessons emphasized the balance between preparation, precision, and technique in creating lasting outdoor features.</p>
