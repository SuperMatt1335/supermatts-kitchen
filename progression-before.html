                    <p class="mb-4">The corner lot had once been a productive vegetable garden, but years of neglect had left it overrun with weeds and cacti. Beneath the overgrowth, we discovered remnants of past use — large concrete footings from a former structure, several hundred feet of broken PVC pipe in multiple sizes, and soil so compacted it was nearly impossible to dig. The space no longer served any purpose and had become an eyesore for the surrounding community.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Challenges</h2>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
                        <li class="mb-2">Overgrown vegetation: Thick weeds, cactus patches, and deep-rooted plants had taken over the lot, requiring extensive manual removal and disposal.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Compacted soil: Years of neglect and lack of watering left the soil extremely hard and resistant to digging or planting.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Hidden debris: Large concrete footings, buried objects, and several hundred feet of broken PVC pipe in multiple sizes made excavation slow and difficult.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Logistical coordination: Organizing volunteers, equipment, and materials for each workday demanded careful scheduling and clear communication to keep the project on track.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Planning Process</h2>
                    <p>To tackle the project effectively, I began by surveying the entire lot and creating a detailed plan outlining each phase of work. I developed a schedule that broke the project into manageable workdays, focusing first on clearing, then soil preparation, irrigation installation, planting, and final assembly of benches and decorative features. I coordinated with parish leaders, secured donations for materials, and organized Scout and community volunteers to help bring the garden back to life.</p>
