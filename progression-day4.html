                    <p class="mb-4">This workday focused on finishing the cleanup and preparing the irrigation system for installation. After spending several previous sessions uncovering the tangled sprinkler network, our goal was to remove all unnecessary components and ensure the layout was ready for the new drip system. Over several hours, we carefully sorted through old lines, tested connections, and positioned new standoffs where needed. By the end of the day, the lot was finally clear, leveled, and ready for landscaping to begin.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Accomplishments</h2>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
                        <li class="mb-2">Completed removal of all unneeded sprinkler heads, pipes, and fittings from the property.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Repaired and rerouted several existing irrigation lines to support the new system layout.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Installed and aligned standoffs for the future drip irrigation network.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Cleaned and organized the site to prepare for upcoming landscaping and planting work.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Material Challenge</h2>
                    <p>A significant challenge during this phase involved dealing with mismatched and damaged irrigation materials. Many of the old PVC lines were of varying diameters and had brittle, sun-worn sections that cracked during removal. Finding compatible replacement fittings and ensuring watertight connections took extra time and precision. Despite these setbacks, our team remained patient and methodical, ensuring that the groundwork for the new irrigation system was properly installed and reliable.</p>
