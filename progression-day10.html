                    <p class="mb-4">This final workday focused on completing the last major installations and ensuring every element of the prayer garden was secure and functioning as intended. We placed the statue of the Holy Family at the center of the garden and installed lighting to illuminate it in the evening. Benches were anchored and positioned to create peaceful areas for reflection, and final adjustments were made to the drip irrigation system to ensure proper coverage for all plants. With these steps complete, the garden reached its finished form — a calm, beautiful space ready for parishioners and families to enjoy.</p>

                        <li class="mb-2">Added accent lighting to highlight the statue and create an inviting nighttime atmosphere.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Positioned and anchored benches, providing stable and comfortable seating for visitors.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Prepared the site for final plaque installation and short-term system monitoring.</li>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Reflections</h2>
                    <p>Completing this final stage was both rewarding and humbling. Watching the statue and benches being set into place felt like the true realization of the project’s purpose — creating a place of peace, prayer, and remembrance. Seeing volunteers, Scouts, and parish members come together to finish the garden reinforced how much collaboration and persistence can accomplish. This project taught me not only about leadership and planning, but also about patience, flexibility, and gratitude. What began as an overgrown lot is now a lasting gift to the community — one that will continue to serve and inspire others for years to come.</p>
