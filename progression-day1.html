                    <p class="mb-4">Several scouts and I excavated five concrete footings from the property. In addition, several large cactus plants and numerous trash bags filled with weeds. Weather permitting, I hope to continue with the project within the next few weeks.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Challenges</h2>
                    <p>This first phase presented several physical challenges. The concrete footings were deeply embedded and required coordinated teamwork and heavy digging tools to remove. We also encountered a massive agave plant with thick, fibrous roots that resisted shoveling and took considerable effort to extract safely. Additionally, the combination of hot weather, uneven ground, and thorny vegetation slowed progress, requiring frequent hydration and caution to prevent injuries.</p>
