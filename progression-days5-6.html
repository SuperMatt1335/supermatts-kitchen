                    <p class="mb-4">These two workdays marked a major step forward in shaping the final layout of the garden. After assessing the remaining trees on the property, we discovered that both were severely damaged and could not be revived. We made the decision to remove and replace them to ensure the long-term health and aesthetics of the space. Once the area was cleared, our focus shifted to constructing the decomposed granite pathways that would define the layout of the prayer garden. Over the course of a day and a half, we graded the surface, leveled the paths, and compacted the granite to create a smooth and durable walking surface.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Challenges</h2>
                    <p>The biggest challenge during this stage was managing the tree removal process safely and efficiently. The roots were deep and intertwined with old irrigation lines, requiring careful cutting and excavation to avoid damage. Transporting and disposing of the heavy tree trunks and root systems also took significant effort. Additionally, working with decomposed granite proved time-consuming, as achieving a consistent grade and compaction required multiple passes and close coordination among volunteers. Despite these challenges, the pathways were completed successfully and gave the site a clear, organized structure for the next phases of planting and installation..</p>
